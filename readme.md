# Coding Challenge Site

This project is a coding challenge site designed to help kids from 4 to 18 years old learn to code and become experts in problem-solving. The site will feature a series of challenges that ramp up in difficulty as the user progresses through different grade levels.

## Technology Stack

This project is being built using vanilla PHP, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Grade Levels

The difficulty of the challenges will be tailored to different age groups:

*   **K-1:** Basic movement challenges using a turtle. Kids will learn to connect simple coding blocks to make the turtle move and change colors.
*   **Middle School:** The turtle gets special abilities like time manipulation and space warping. Challenges will involve geometry and trigonometry.
*   **High School (Grades 11-12):** The playful elements are removed, and the focus shifts to pure coding. The challenges will be equivalent to bachelor's and master's level computer science problems, designed to impress potential employers.

The goal is to create a fun and engaging learning experience that takes kids from their first steps in coding to becoming expert problem solvers.
